##  Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation – Basic TCP Port Scanner (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Create a CLI-based TCP connect scanner (like nmap -sT)

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Scan single target IP for TCP port ranges
- ✅ Report open ports with detailed information
- ✅ Multithreaded scanning for improved performance
- ✅ Configurable timeout and worker count

### ✅ Phase 2: Add Banner Grabbing (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Identify basic services by grabbing banners from open ports

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Banner grabbing from open ports
- ✅ Basic service identification (SSH, HTTP, FTP, etc.)
- ✅ Enhanced service detection using banner analysis

### ✅ Phase 3: Async/Parallel Scanner Engine (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Make scanning scalable and fast (1000+ targets/ports)

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Enhanced goroutine management with worker pools
- ✅ Connection pooling optimization
- ✅ Advanced timeout handling and retry logic
- ✅ Rate limiting and throttling for stealth scanning

### ✅ Phase 4: Service & OS Fingerprinting (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Use TTL, banner info, and heuristics for OS/service identification

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ TTL analysis (Linux=64, Windows=128, Cisco=255)
- ✅ Banner signature comparison with regex patterns
- ✅ Advanced service fingerprinting with confidence scoring
- ✅ Multi-method OS detection algorithms

### ✅ Phase 5: Multi-Target & Subnet Scanning (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Allow CIDR notation and multiple IP scanning

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ CIDR notation support (192.168.1.0/24)
- ✅ IP range parsing and validation
- ✅ Parallel subnet scanning with grouping
- ✅ Multiple target formats and hostname resolution

### ✅ Phase 6: Plugin System (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Allow extensibility via scripts (like Nmap NSE)

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Full Lua scripting environment with gopher-lua
- ✅ Rich plugin API for HTTP, TCP, regex, and logging
- ✅ Auto-loading plugin system with category support
- ✅ Example plugins (WordPress detection, SSH enumeration)

### ✅ Phase 7: Web GUI (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Create user-friendly web interface

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ React frontend with Material-UI components
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket communication for live updates
- ✅ Interactive scan progress and results visualization
- ✅ Export results (HTML, JSON, CSV) with professional formatting

### ✅ Phase 8: Advanced Recon Features (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Advanced features beyond traditional Nmap

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Comprehensive reconnaissance engine
- ✅ Subdomain enumeration with multiple sources
- ✅ DNS analysis and record inspection
- ✅ Web technology detection and vulnerability scanning
