# Security Policy

## üîí Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in OMAP, please report it responsibly.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities

Instead, please email security findings to: [your-email@domain.com]

### What to Include

When reporting security issues, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
3. **Reproduction**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Environment**: OS, Go version, OMAP version
5. **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands demonstrating the issue
6. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies by severity (see below)

## üö® Severity Levels

### Critical (24-48 hours)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation to system level

### High (1 week)
- Local privilege escalation
- Information disclosure of sensitive data
- DoS attacks affecting availability

### Medium (2 weeks)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Information disclosure of non-sensitive data
- Input validation issues

### Low (1 month)
- Information disclosure with minimal impact
- Minor configuration issues
- Documentation security improvements

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices for Users

### General Usage
- Run OMAP with minimal required privileges
- Use dedicated scanning accounts when possible
- Regularly update to the latest version
- Monitor scanning activities and logs

### Network Scanning
- Only scan networks you own or have permission to test
- Be aware of local laws and regulations
- Use rate limiting to avoid overwhelming targets
- Consider using VPNs or isolated networks for testing

### Plugin Security
- Only use trusted plugins
- Review plugin source code before use
- Run plugins in isolated environments when possible
- Be cautious with plugins requiring elevated privileges

### Web Interface
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Implement proper authentication
- Limit access to authorized users only
- Keep web dependencies updated

## üîß Security Features

### Built-in Protections
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Timeout controls for all operations
- Secure defaults for all configurations

### Scanning Safety
- Connection timeouts to prevent hanging
- Resource limits to prevent DoS
- Error handling to prevent information leakage
- Logging of all scanning activities

### Plugin Sandbox
- Limited API surface for plugins
- Timeout controls for plugin execution
- Error isolation between plugins
- Resource monitoring and limits

## üìã Security Checklist for Developers

### Code Review
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Output sanitization applied
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Authentication and authorization properly implemented
- [ ] Crypto uses secure algorithms and implementations
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets

### Testing
- [ ] Security tests included
- [ ] Fuzzing performed on input parsers
- [ ] Dependency scanning completed
- [ ] Static analysis tools used
- [ ] Manual penetration testing performed

### Deployment
- [ ] Secure defaults configured
- [ ] Unnecessary features disabled
- [ ] Proper file permissions set
- [ ] Network access restricted
- [ ] Logging and monitoring enabled

## üîç Known Security Considerations

### Network Scanning Risks
- **Target Impact**: Aggressive scanning can cause service disruption
- **Legal Issues**: Unauthorized scanning may violate laws
- **Detection**: Scanning activities are often logged and monitored

### Privilege Requirements
- **Raw Sockets**: Some features require elevated privileges
- **ICMP**: OS fingerprinting may need root/admin access
- **Port Binding**: Low port scanning requires privileges

### Plugin Risks
- **Code Execution**: Lua plugins can execute arbitrary code
- **Network Access**: Plugins have network access capabilities
- **File System**: Plugins may access local files

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardening Recommendations

### System Level
```bash
# Run with limited user account
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false omap-scanner
sudo -u omap-scanner ./omap

# Use AppArmor/SELinux profiles
# Limit network access with iptables
# Use containers for isolation
```

### Application Level
```bash
# Disable unnecessary features
./omap --no-plugins --no-web-interface

# Use configuration files instead of command line
./omap --config secure-config.json

# Enable verbose logging
./omap --log-level debug --log-file scan.log
```

### Network Level
- Use dedicated scanning VLANs
- Implement egress filtering
- Monitor scanning traffic
- Use intrusion detection systems
